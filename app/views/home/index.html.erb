  <p>Thomas and I are going across America to see the beautiful country we live in.  Along the way we'll be photographing, videoing, and just generally chronicling our journey, which you will be able to keep up with on this site!  There will be a live location tracker, blog posts, photos, and videos.  I'm sure they'll all be priceless.  But if you had to assign a price to it... you could donate that to our trip!  As it turns out, a month long road trip isn't cheap.  That's where you come in.</p>
  <p>We've calculated fuel costs, motel costs, and food costs and have come up with a goal amount of $5,000.  You're probably asking, "Hey! What do I get for sending you on this trip?".  Well I'm glad you asked!  There are some incentives, depending on how much you give.  Allow me to present to you, the chart:</p>

  <p>For any amount you donate, you will get all incentives at, and below your donation (except where *'d (usually because it would be redundant)).</p>
